The previously complicated method was made more user-friendly by developing the new software CognitiveMapr for which she received a grant from the FAIR Research IT Innovation Fund. There are more projects that received a grant from the fund, such as Kees Klein Goldewijk’s HYDE database. Learn more about cognitive mapping.\n\n\nFAIR Cheat Sheets have been Published\nFinding your way around the FAIR principles may prove to be a little daunting. That is why science historian and philosopher Susanna Bloem made grateful use of the FAIR Cheatsheets developed by experts from the Utrecht University Open Science Programme and RDM Support in consultation with researchers from several faculties. Read all about how she used this useful checklist to see if her data and code adhered to the FAIR principles. Learn more about FAIR Cheat Sheets"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Event Time and date: 12 September 2024 - 15 to 17hr Location: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, Universiteitsbibliotheek (Utrecht Science Park)\nDo you want to improve your programming skills, meet colleagues interested in coding, or ask questions related to research software? Pick up your laptop and come to the Programming Café!\nIn this monthly meet-up, we will share knowledge about programming through short presentations, work on software projects, and help each other with challenges in working with code and data.\nThis month’s theme: Introducing iBridges\nDo you already use Yoda to store your data? Would you like to find out what else the system can do?\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate how to leverage the full potential of Yoda through a new tool box called iBridges. iBridges consists of a python library to easily program against data, a command line tool for streamlined uploading and downloading of data, and a graphical user interface to enhance the experience of using Yoda. We will present a compute workflow that uses data in Yoda, generates results, and levels them with data. Subsequently, the results can be found by a non-programming user employing the GUI and downloading the results of the compute workflow. Join us to explore the functionality hidden inside of Yoda.\nWhat to expect\nDuring the Programming Café, you can work on your own project and share knowledge in a community setting. You can also bring your programming questions, bugs, and problems to discuss or resolve with members of Information Technology Support, Research Data Services, and researchers attending the café. In addition, each Programming Café will have a special theme. This is typically a short presentation or demonstration of (maximum) half an hour. We are always looking for suggestions on themes and people who want to present something. Don’t hesitate to send an email to info.rdm@uu.nl if you want to provide a suggestion or give a presentation!\nWho can attend\nEveryone is welcome at the Programming Café! You can be of any skill level and at any stage in working with your code and data. While many attendees will be R or Python users, people interested in other programming languages and software are invited as well.\nFull information can be found at (uu.nl/rdm)[https://www.uu.nl/en/events/programming-cafe-12-september-2024]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Upcoming Workshop: Building the Commons\nThe implementation of Open Science across the Netherlands is beginning to reorient the way people at knowledge organisations structure their work. Institutions are affirming these changes by reimaging programs for Recognition & Reward and developing innovative networks such as DCCs (Digital Competence Centers). By exploring these modes of support and collaboration across the Netherlands, this interactive session will co-design structures that facilitate community, valorisation, and care as intrinsic to science.\nThe workshop “Building the Commons: How Open Science and DCCs Bring About New Ways of Working” will be divided into three parts. The initial presentation will establish a shared foundation for ideas around open and networked modes of knowledge production, introducing the concept of the commons. The second section will showcase a series of spaces already beginning to enact this type of cooperation within and among organisations in the Netherlands, including Utrecht DCC, VU Art Science, the Dutch Open Science Communities, and the national TDCC. Finally, participants will engage in a collective exercise to design common networks across their communities. The session is intended for people working in research and research support who are interested in the connections and infrastructure that generate Open Science.\nDuring this session, we will assert that the present moment in the Netherlands is an extraordinary opportunity to build such knowledge commons due to the national commitment to Open Science and the unique affiliations among present knowledge workers. We seek to build upon this collaborative spirit to render our work more inclusive, engaged, diverse, equitable, and meaningful. People attending this session will gain insight into projects that rethink cooperation as well as a framework and lexicon to render those types of efforts more visible and resilient. The output will be designs and resources that help people participate in and replicate open and networked forms of knowledge production.\nOrganized by: Coosje Veldkamp, Utrecht University Anna van ’t Veer, OSC-NL Martine de Vos, Utrecht University Nicole Emmenegger, TDCC–SSH Dan Rudmann, Utrecht University Lieke de Boer, Netherlands eScience Center Lena Karvovskaya, Vrije Universiteit Lilli van Wielink, Utrecht University\nThe workshop will be held at the Netherlands National Open Science Festival at Maastricht University on October 22, 2024."

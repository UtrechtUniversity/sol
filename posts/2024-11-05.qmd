## UDCC Forum 
Tuesday, November 12, 2024 
10-12hr 
Vening Meineszgebouw A, room 1.13

## Invitation 
The UDCC network convenes its Forum on the second Tuesday of every month.

These meetings typically consist of two parts. The first half is an open agenda, curated for community members to share their work and interests across the network. The second hour features a deeper dive into a particular hot topic. 
The UDCC Forum is open to all colleagues at Utrecht University interested in digital competencies.

November 12 will be the soft launch of the UDCC Forum and begins with a brief roundtable discussion on the intent and trajectory of the UDCC. The in-depth presentation this month will be on the Utrecht University Landscape for Data Storage by Mercedes Beltr√°n and Rene Aldelerhof. As spaces to keep research data fill to the brim, we will explore what options are available to the Utrecht University to keep data safe and retrievable.

The Forum is moveable - landing each month in a different location throughout the UU. We hope to see you at the Vening Meineszgebouw on November 12th. 

## What is the UDCC? 

The UDCC is the network of all research support teams at Utrecht University.
The UDCC network exists to traverse borders, increase visibility, and experience a sense of community in co-creating digital competencies to support research at Utrecht University. Together, research support staff weave diverse resources for research data, software, and infrastructure, building more resilient and robust modes of support by sharing knowledge and collectivising across the institution.
By combining our knowledge and strengths, together we can achieve results that would not be possible for individual teams.

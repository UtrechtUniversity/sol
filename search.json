    "text": "How to be FAIR\n\nLatest FAIR Story About Cognitive Mapping Published\nIn this interview, Femke van Esch tells us about Cognitive Mapping, a method for mapping people’s beliefs and reasoning. The previously complicated method was made more user-friendly by developing the new software CognitiveMapr for which she received a grant from the FAIR Research IT Innovation Fund. There are more projects that received a grant from the fund, such as Kees Klein Goldewijk’s HYDE database. Learn more about cognitive mapping.\n\n\nFAIR Cheat Sheets have been Published\nFinding your way around the FAIR principles may prove to be a little daunting. That is why science historian and philosopher Susanna Bloem made grateful use of the FAIR Cheatsheets developed by experts from the Utrecht University Open Science Programme and RDM Support in consultation with researchers from several faculties. Read all about how she used this useful checklist to see if her data and code adhered to the FAIR principles. Learn more about FAIR Cheat Sheets"

The Geo Data Team managed to retrieve the data from these outdated data carriers and opened up the research data that Martin Wassen had collected for over four decades. Watch datasteward Garrett Speed present the project here. Read more about the Data Odyssey Project.\n\n\nFaculty Support Teams\nWe continuously update our website. Last time you received the newsletter, we mentioned we updated all the guides, now we’ve added information about the faculty support teams. We always welcome input on info.rdm@uu.nl.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Event Time and date: 12 September 2024 - 15 to 17hr Location: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, Universiteitsbibliotheek (Utrecht Science Park)\nDo you want to improve your programming skills, meet colleagues interested in coding, or ask questions related to research software? Pick up your laptop and come to the Programming Café!\nIn this monthly meet-up, we will share knowledge about programming through short presentations, work on software projects, and help each other with challenges in working with code and data.\nThis month’s theme: Introducing iBridges\nDo you already use Yoda to store your data? Would you like to find out what else the system can do?\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate how to leverage the full potential of Yoda through a new tool box called iBridges. iBridges consists of a python library to easily program against data, a command line tool for streamlined uploading and downloading of data, and a graphical user interface to enhance the experience of using Yoda. We will present a compute workflow that uses data in Yoda, generates results, and levels them with data. Subsequently, the results can be found by a non-programming user employing the GUI and downloading the results of the compute workflow. Join us to explore the functionality hidden inside of Yoda.\nWhat to expect\nDuring the Programming Café, you can work on your own project and share knowledge in a community setting. You can also bring your programming questions, bugs, and problems to discuss or resolve with members of Information Technology Support, Research Data Services, and researchers attending the café. In addition, each Programming Café will have a special theme. This is typically a short presentation or demonstration of (maximum) half an hour. We are always looking for suggestions on themes and people who want to present something. Don’t hesitate to send an email to info.rdm@uu.nl if you want to provide a suggestion or give a presentation!\nWho can attend\nEveryone is welcome at the Programming Café! You can be of any skill level and at any stage in working with your code and data. While many attendees will be R or Python users, people interested in other programming languages and software are invited as well.\nFull information can be found at (uu.nl/rdm)[https://www.uu.nl/en/events/programming-cafe-12-september-2024]"

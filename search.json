    "text": "Event Time and date: 12 September 2024 - 15 to 17hr Location: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, Universiteitsbibliotheek (Utrecht Science Park)\nDo you want to improve your programming skills, meet colleagues interested in coding, or ask questions related to research software? Pick up your laptop and come to the Programming Café!\nIn this monthly meet-up, we will share knowledge about programming through short presentations, work on software projects, and help each other with challenges in working with code and data.\nThis month’s theme: Introducing iBridges\nDo you already use Yoda to store your data? Would you like to find out what else the system can do?\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate how to leverage the full potential of Yoda through a new tool box called iBridges. iBridges consists of a python library to easily program against data, a command line tool for streamlined uploading and downloading of data, and a graphical user interface to enhance the experience of using Yoda. We will present a compute workflow that uses data in Yoda, generates results, and levels them with data. Subsequently, the results can be found by a non-programming user employing the GUI and downloading the results of the compute workflow. Join us to explore the functionality hidden inside of Yoda.\nWhat to expect\nDuring the Programming Café, you can work on your own project and share knowledge in a community setting. You can also bring your programming questions, bugs, and problems to discuss or resolve with members of Information Technology Support, Research Data Services, and researchers attending the café. In addition, each Programming Café will have a special theme. This is typically a short presentation or demonstration of (maximum) half an hour. We are always looking for suggestions on themes and people who want to present something. Don’t hesitate to send an email to info.rdm@uu.nl if you want to provide a suggestion or give a presentation!\nWho can attend\nEveryone is welcome at the Programming Café! You can be of any skill level and at any stage in working with your code and data. While many attendees will be R or Python users, people interested in other programming languages and software are invited as well.\nFull information can be found at (uu.nl/rdm)[https://www.uu.nl/en/events/programming-cafe-12-september-2024]"

The UDCC Forum is open to all colleagues at Utrecht University interested in digital competencies.\nNovember 12 will be the soft launch of the UDCC Forum and begins with a brief roundtable discussion on the intent and trajectory of the UDCC. The in-depth presentation this month will be on the Utrecht University Landscape for Data Storage by Mercedes Beltrán and Rene Aldelerhof. As spaces to keep research data fill to the brim, we will explore what options are available to the Utrecht University to keep data safe and retrievable.\nThe Forum is moveable - landing each month in a different location throughout the UU. We hope to see you at the Vening Meineszgebouw on November 12th."

    "text": "Upcoming Workshop: Building the Commons\nThe implementation of Open Science across the Netherlands is beginning to reorient the way people at knowledge organisations structure their work. Institutions are affirming these changes by reimaging programs for Recognition & Reward and developing innovative networks such as DCCs (Digital Competence Centers). By exploring these modes of support and collaboration across the Netherlands, this interactive session will co-design structures that facilitate community, valorisation, and care as intrinsic to science.\nThe workshop “Building the Commons: How Open Science and DCCs Bring About New Ways of Working” will be divided into three parts. The initial presentation will establish a shared foundation for ideas around open and networked modes of knowledge production, introducing the concept of the commons. The second section will showcase a series of spaces already beginning to enact this type of cooperation within and among organisations in the Netherlands, including Utrecht DCC, VU Art Science, the Dutch Open Science Communities, and the national TDCC. Finally, participants will engage in a collective exercise to design common networks across their communities. The session is intended for people working in research and research support who are interested in the connections and infrastructure that generate Open Science.\nDuring this session, we will assert that the present moment in the Netherlands is an extraordinary opportunity to build such knowledge commons due to the national commitment to Open Science and the unique affiliations among present knowledge workers. We seek to build upon this collaborative spirit to render our work more inclusive, engaged, diverse, equitable, and meaningful. People attending this session will gain insight into projects that rethink cooperation as well as a framework and lexicon to render those types of efforts more visible and resilient. The output will be designs and resources that help people participate in and replicate open and networked forms of knowledge production.\nOrganized by: Coosje Veldkamp, Utrecht University Anna van ’t Veer, OSC-NL Martine de Vos, Utrecht University Nicole Emmenegger, TDCC–SSH Dan Rudmann, Utrecht University Lieke de Boer, Netherlands eScience Center Lena Karvovskaya, Vrije Universiteit Lilli van Wielink, Utrecht University\nThe workshop will be held at the Netherlands National Open Science Festival at Maastricht University on October 22, 2024."

They work on projects with the software engineers, give data and software trainings, and coordinate the faculty data stewards. They have 1 coordinator, 4 data managers, 1 DCC coordinator and 1 project manager (if I interpreted correctly).\nIT (DCC): software engineers. They work on project with the data managers from the library. Their team consists of an innovation team and 8 software engineers. Some of them are experts in HPC and AI/ML.\nFaculty support staff: every faculty has 1 or 2 data stewards and they pick up most of the tasks we at RDS call “consultancy” (DMP and data review, answering questions and referring to other experts). These data stewards are coordinated by the library. Some faculties additionally have “local” data managers and RSEs, who are usually PhDs and postdocs in research groups."

This is in kind and free of charge for max. 2 days a week. They do a call for applications each year and they pick up about 15 projects per year. Support tasks are agreed upon during the initial week(s), with a promise of effort (not deliverables). Ideally 2 support people are involved in each project and solutions should be developed through co-creation: active collaboration is essential, because solutions will need to be maintained by the researchers, and the aim is to transfer knowledge. Projects are selected if they are feasible, match with DCC expertise, are maintainable and have a positive impact in the research community, and can lead to FAIR output.\nCourses and workshops: data and software carpentries, coderefinery, GitCoDev, FAIR4RS (12-week program to support adoption of digital skills), Open science MOOC, Open Hardware academy\nCommunity and Resources: DCC guides + R Cafe"

Important questions that one should ask themselves are: What tests, how many, how much testing is enough?\nExample software mentioned by Niket:\n\nRobotics: Motion planner\nCoastal engineering: simulate sediment transport\nChemistry: calculating properties on catalyst structure\n\nThe commonality in these softwares is that the software requires an input file, does something with it, and then spits out an output file. This can be a starting point for writing software tests. For example: test if an output file is generated; and then test the content of the output file, etc.\nNiket’s takeaways were to 1) Begin with writing a high-level test, and 2) Visualize the process of what the software should be doing."

    "text": "Unconference and Snakemake\nThe afternoon ended with an “Unconference” session where several topics were discussed in groups based on interest. I myself instead joined the Snakemake workshop by UU engineers Raoul and Matty. Snakemake is a workflow engine (just like Galaxy or Make), which is not focused on a user interface but more towards programmers. So.. this was quite a challenge for me as a non/terrible programmer :)\nSome interesting facts about Snakemake:\n\nIt was inspired by Make and the configuration file is called a snakefile (instead of a makefile)\nIt is a “syntactical extension of Python”: you can write Python in your snakefile\nIt supports different execution backends (SLURM) and remote storage (S3). There is also a plugin for iRods\n\nBasically, you create a snakefile that defines rules and commands which have to be run. Each rule has an input, output and a shell argument which specifies which file (e.g., code file) to run. The workshop materials are on GitHub. Tip: the solutions are in the solution branch.\nI was honestly terrible at figuring out how this worked, but the fun thing was that I was paired up with a TU Delft programmer/engineer who had the same difficulties as me. So we had fun, but in order for me to actually learn how to use this, I’ll probably have to ask Raoul and Matty first!"

Is it everything collected via webscraping? All social media research? Questionnaire data with 1000s of participants? After taking a lot of questions into consideration, the decision was made to both make the term more specific (“Human-related big data research”), as well as to provide clear definitions in the guide itself. The following aspects are considered to fall within the scope of the guide:\n\nbig data: data already published or collected elsewhere in which direct contact with the “data subject” is not reasonably possible. Examples are data from mobile phones, smart devices, social media, transactional data or sensors.\ncontactless research: research in which there is no direct contact with data subjects.\nhuman-related data: research in which data from people is collected or used. This can be both personal or anonymous data."

It contains sections on responsible collection of data, privacy, ethics, data management, data integrity, etc. The nice thing is that references are made to general information on the RDM website and the Data Privacy Handbook wherever possible, but also to central facilities like Information and Knowledge security and faculty regulations. In that sense, it was a great UDCC project well before the UDCC has been officially in place :)\n\nMore background can be found in the news item on the UU intranet\nThe persistent and public version of the guide is on Zenodo"

The previously complicated method was made more user-friendly by developing the new software CognitiveMapr for which she received a grant from the FAIR Research IT Innovation Fund. There are more projects that received a grant from the fund, such as Kees Klein Goldewijk’s HYDE database. Learn more about cognitive mapping.\n\n\nFAIR Cheat Sheets have been Published\nFinding your way around the FAIR principles may prove to be a little daunting. That is why science historian and philosopher Susanna Bloem made grateful use of the FAIR Cheatsheets developed by experts from the Utrecht University Open Science Programme and RDM Support in consultation with researchers from several faculties. Read all about how she used this useful checklist to see if her data and code adhered to the FAIR principles. Learn more about FAIR Cheat Sheets"

The Geo Data Team managed to retrieve the data from these outdated data carriers and opened up the research data that Martin Wassen had collected for over four decades. Watch datasteward Garrett Speed present the project here. Read more about the Data Odyssey Project.\n\n\nFaculty Support Teams\nWe continuously update our website. Last time you received the newsletter, we mentioned we updated all the guides, now we’ve added information about the faculty support teams. We always welcome input on info.rdm@uu.nl. The upcoming period we will be working on FAQ’s for Yoda."
